Thoughts after finishing this project:

On my journey to become a great developer I believe practicing and creating projects is key.
Working with APIs is a crucial skill as a developer, that's why I picked this project.
Will be doing more complex projects with 3rd-party APIs in the near future but I think this was a first great introduction.
